# Pygame-N
Pygame-N is a extension module that replaces the original pygame module. This module helps Nython(Python extension N language) to process multiwindow
mainwindowed pygame scripts.
Which means you can run multiple pygame scripts at one time and they will all show as seperate windows inside the main one. 
This is a module inside the AimlessOS project which helps with window controlling.
Moreover, it brought back the module: pygame.movie to pygame and you are allowed to set the blitting area for the movie without using any other module.
